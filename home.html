                    and physical well being. If you are not born again, be ready in all humility to submit your life to God. 
                    And we will pray for you. and we believe that God will speak to you and your week wiil be full of favors, 
                    promotion and great increase in Jesus name.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church was established and registered in Nigeria. The main vision and mission in 
                    establishing this church is to fully preach the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ to change people,s life frrom 
                    darkness into His marvelous light by the power of the gospel. The Gospel is so powerful that it has authority
                    and means to bring people to Salvation through the gospel of Christ, God exercises His power to save men from 
                    eternal damnation and destruction. it is a potent means by which God teaches, motivates and create Salvation to 
                    those who exercise trust in those words (Romans 1:16). <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus did not come to this world to establish another
                    religion but to show us the nature of God, which is love and taught us to manifest the same in  our relationship
                    with God and our fellow human beings. This is the Gospel, the good news. it is about God's love to the world through
                    His son Jesus Christ. Jesus came to lead man back to God and help man to fulfill purpose. There is no way a man will
                    be fully committed to gospel that he will not acknowlegde the true God, live in obedience to his word and will not discover his purpose for fulfillment. 
                    <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who truly believes the Gospel will be motivated to change his or her life to fit the purpose which God is working, 
                    and to be in an alignment with the Gospel.
                    The good news is composed of words that carry in them the power to move our lives towards salvation if we believe them enough to unleash
                    their power by putting them into practice words and spirit (John 6:63) and they impel us in the direction of their meaning if we choose to submit
                    to them. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall also pray for our dear country because we owe a duty to our nation to pray against disasters, flooding, 
                    outbreak of fire, the unabated insecurity caused by armed-robbers, kidnappers and terrorists, Fulani herdsmen etc. We believe the Lord will answer
                     our prayers in Jesus name.</p>
